# Action

```js
import { Action } from 'piny-forest'
```

Small text-like button component. Accepts same variants as [Text](#text),
but behaves like [Button](#button).

Color on `:hover` can be changed with `accent` prop.

```jsx live
<Action>Normal</Action>
<Action accent='destructive'>Destructive</Action>
```
